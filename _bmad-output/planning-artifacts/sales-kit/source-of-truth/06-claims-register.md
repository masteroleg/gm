# Claims Register

## Safe claims

| ID | Claim | Usage rule |
|----|-------|------------|
| C-01 | `genu.mark is the strong line core for еАкциз implementation.` | Use broadly in regulated assets |
| C-02 | `ERP is external in two roles: source of production job and exchange of results/statuses.` | Must appear whenever architecture is shown |
| C-03 | `еАкциз is a separate external contour.` | Use wherever external boundaries are shown |
| C-04 | `Strong core first reduces launch risk, overload, and manual error.` | Safe commercial framing |
| C-05 | `Dominanta + Logictime gives the buyer a more controllable implementation path.` | Safe comparative framing |
| C-06 | `25M+ industrial deployment in Ukraine.` | Use as written; do not inflate |
| C-07 | `Public proof does not replace official or legal verification.` | Use whenever public proof is mentioned |

## Qualified claims

| ID | Claim | Usage rule |
|----|-------|------------|
| Q-01 | Segment-specific strength wording for SZZR / plant-protection market | Use only in tailored reviewed material |
| Q-02 | Case-comparison wording based on open-source review | Use only with attribution and careful scope |

## Blocked claims

Never use externally:
- `ми єдині`, `№1`, `найбільші`, `тільки ми можемо`;
- `guaranteed compliance`, `ensures compliance`, `guarantees acceptance`;
- any wording that makes `ERP` or `еАкциз` part of the core;
- any early regulated narrative that introduces `genu.code`;
- any opening sell that makes `genu.im` the main object of sale.

## Mandatory fail gate

Reject the asset if:
- it says only `ERP integration` and hides the two-role split;
- it shows `еАкциз` as part of the core;
- it sounds stronger than what can be calmly defended in a buyer meeting;
- it reads like internal planning notes.

## Replacement guide

| Risky wording | Replace with |
|---------------|--------------|
| `platform / ecosystem offer` | `strong line core plus external contours` |
| `ERP integration` | `ERP -> production job; ERP / internal systems <- results and statuses` |
| `proof solves compliance` | `proof supports review but does not replace official verification` |
| `full contour from day one` | `start from the core and connect external blocks deliberately` |
