# genu.im Business Model: Real Pricing

**Category:** business  
**Tags:** pricing, saas, b2b  
**Created:** 2026-02-18

## Actual Pricing (January 2026)

| Service | Price | Unit |
|---------|-------|------|
| Print/Marking | $2.00 | per 1,000 codes |
| Storage | $0.43 | per 1,000 codes |
| Verification | $7.00 | per 1,000 scans |

## Real Revenue Data (Ukravit, January 2026)

- **Print:** 32,900 UAH / 278,441 codes = ~$2.88/1K
- **Storage:** 15,980 UAH / 867,094 codes = ~$0.45/1K
- **Verification:** 5 scans total (negligible)

**Monthly revenue:** ~$1,193 USD (print + storage only)

## Competitive Position

| Competitor | Price | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Сайтекс | $250-500/month per line | Print + analytics, NO verification |
| genu.im | Usage-based | Print + analytics + verification |

**Key differentiator:** Consumer verification layer — Сайтекс doesn't have it.

## Target Customer Profile

1. **Alcohol manufacturers** — compliance + consumer-facing
2. **Tobacco products** — compliance + consumer-facing
3. **Food/beverage** — consumer-facing, emerging compliance

**NOT target:** B2B-only products (agricultural chemicals, industrial)

## Why Verification Revenue Was Low

Ukravit = agricultural chemicals (B2B). End consumers don't scan QR codes. Only 5 scans in January because there's no retail consumer behavior.
