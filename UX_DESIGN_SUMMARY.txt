## Location of Complete Discussions
Found in 3 main Claude CLI session JSONL files:
1. d0cd1940-c774-432a-9f3f-d27724b57e60.jsonl (1244 lines, CREATIVE/PARTY MODE - largest)
2. c35eadbf-3b34-4ab1-b9c8-8bf7341a04b6.jsonl (406 lines, PRD/PLANNING)

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS EXTRACTED

### 1. THREE EMOTIONAL APPROACHES (Party Mode Session)
- **Concept A "The Proof"** (Documentary): White, monospaced, institutional trust
- **Concept B "The Moment"** (Cinematic): Dark, dramatic reveal animation, spring easing
- **Concept C "The Signal"** (Tech): Animated radar pulses, two only then stop
- **Decision**: Use A for landing (trust), B for verification badge (emotion), C for loading

### 2. "ТИХА СИЛА" (QUIET STRENGTH) PRINCIPLE  
- Function = Trust. Not wow-design, but works-like-it-should
- Riff with Diya.gov.ua aesthetic (not copy)
- < 1 sec load time, no unnecessary animations
- Offline-first thinking (Ukraine 2026 blackouts)

### 3. THREE-TIER PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE
Epic 1: Landing Page (genu.im/) - vitrine, B2B pitch, SEO
Epic 2: Verification Pages (genu.im/v/{code}) - THE PRODUCT, most visited, proof-of-concept
Epic 3: B2B Portal (genu.im/portal/) - client dashboard, retention

### 4. SINGLE FLOW, THREE RESONANCES
Not "B2B section / B2C section" but ONE narrative hitting three emotional triggers:
- CEO: fear (compliance, counterfeits)
- Marketing: opportunity (data, analytics, geography)
- Consumer: safety (authentic/not decision)

### 5. VERIFICATION PAGE: "CASE FILE → VERDICT"
- Micro-story: Investigation methodology
- Four states: AUTHENTIC (#0d8a4f green), SUSPICIOUS (#b45309 amber), NOT FOUND (#b91c1c red), OFFLINE (#475569 slate)
- Scan history as core differentiator (anti-fraud + analytics seed)
- Spring easing badge animation (630ms) = physical stamp feel

### 6. VERTICAL-SPECIFIC PASSPORTS (/v/ routes)
One template, JSON data + CSS modifiers:
- genu.im/v/genuim (platform)
- genu.im/v/genuim-alco (alcohol: warm, celebratory)
- genu.im/v/genuim-tobacco (tobacco: strict, compliance)
- genu.im/v/genuim-food (food: fresh, natural)
Each has different emotion/micro-story, same brand DNA (champagne + green)

### 7. COLOR SYSTEM
Light: Champagne (#f5f2ed) + Green (#0d8a4f) + White
Dark: Slate + Muted green
Four-state palette for results: authentic (green), suspicious (amber), not found (red), offline (slate)

### 8. TYPOGRAPHY
Inter (body) + IBM Plex Mono (codes/timestamps) + System fonts fallback
No serif except case ID numbers (legal weight)
Mobile-first scale: 32px display → 16px body → 12px caption

### 9. ANIMATION SPEC
Badge reveal: 200ms darken + 280ms spring scale + ring expand + 150ms lighten = 630ms total
Loading: Two radar pulses (300ms gap), then STOP (no third = loss of trust)
Mobile menu: 200ms slide-in only
No continuous animations (tired after 2-3 seconds)

### 10. CRITICAL HERO COPY (from Sophia, Storyteller)
Q: "Ви впевнені?" (Are you sure?) 
A: "Ми — так." (We are.)
Opens with doubt (three audiences feel it), answers with confidence

### 11. ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
WCAG 2.1 AA minimum (4.5:1 contrast)
Keyboard nav: tabindex, aria-label on icons
Screen reader: alt text, role="article" on results
Mobile: 48px touch targets, 16px form inputs

### 12. PERFORMANCE TARGETS
Lighthouse ≥ 95
LCP < 2.5s
CLS < 0.1
Service worker cache for landing + template
No javascript frameworks (vanilla JS only for Epic 1+2)

### 13. PRE-MORTEM RISKS (6 identified)
1. API onboarding too complex → CSV + Pro upgrade path
2. SUSPICIOUS state blocks sales → configurable threshold + education
3. Low consumer engagement → brand push responsibility, viral sharing og:image
4. Minimalism feels cheap → spring easing badge = impact without drama
5. Offline untested → E2E tests with Playwright offline simulation
6. Portal 10+ screens in vanilla JS → Petite-Vue for Epic 3

### 14. MULTILINGUAL STRATEGY
EN + UK support
data-i18n attributes + JS translation object
Locale-specific tone: English professional, Ukrainian warm+direct

### 15. BUSINESS SUCCESS CRITERIA
5K+ monthly visitors, 15%+ demo click-through
≥ 10 B2B leads/month
25M+ codes/year verification volume
NPS ≥ 7/10 trust score

## DECISION REASONING DOCUMENTED

Each major decision includes:
- Who proposed it (character name + role)
- Why it matters (business + UX impact)
- What was rejected and why (alternatives considered)
- How it connects to other decisions (dependencies)
- Metrics for success

## CONVERSATIONS FULLY PRESERVED

The complete session discussions are available in:
- d0cd1940-c774-432a-9f3f-d27724b57e60.jsonl (Creative session - most comprehensive)
- c35eadbf-3b34-4ab1-b9c8-8bf7341a04b6.jsonl (PRD planning - strategic context)

These can be extracted into full narrative document with all agent perspectives intact.

## NEXT STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. Use this summary to brief design team
2. Extract full conversations from JSONL for complete reasoning doc
3. Create detailed component library based on specifications
4. Begin HTML/CSS implementation per Epic 1 scope
5. Set up E2E tests per performance/accessibility criteria
6. Schedule user testing with personas (CEO, marketer, consumer)
