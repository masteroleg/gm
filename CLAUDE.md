# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Static landing page for [genu.im](https://genu.im) — a verification and transparency tool. Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no framework, no backend.

## Commands

```bash
# Develop
npm run dev          # Watch Tailwind CSS changes (runs tailwindcss --watch)
npm start            # Serve site locally at http://localhost:3000

# Build
npm run build:css    # Compile & minify Tailwind CSS (input.css → output.css)

# Test
npm test             # Jest unit tests
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright E2E tests (requires local server running first)

# E2E with local server in one step
npm start &          # Start server in background, then:
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test

# Run a single Playwright test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/genuim.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/e2e/genuim.spec.js --project=chromium

# Run a specific test by name
npx playwright test -g "theme toggle"
```

## Architecture

### File layout

- `index.html` — single-page HTML, all content lives here
- `assets/css/input.css` — Tailwind v4 source with full custom theme variables
- `assets/css/output.css` — compiled CSS (do not edit directly, generated by build)
- `assets/js/theme-toggle.js` — dark/light mode logic
- `assets/js/lang-toggle.js` — EN/UK i18n switcher
- `assets/js/menu.js` — mobile burger menu open/close
- `tests/e2e/` — Playwright specs
- `tests/` — Jest unit tests + manual browser console tests

### Key design decisions

**FOUC prevention:** An inline `<script>` in `<head>` runs before DOM render, setting the `.dark` class and `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` from localStorage (or system preference). Any theme-related JS changes must consider this early script.

**Theme system:** Tailwind v4 custom CSS variables define two palettes — "Champagne & Ivory" (light) and "Midnight Sapphire" (dark). The `.dark` class on `<html>` switches between them. `data-theme` attribute mirrors the active theme for Playwright selectors.

**i18n:** `lang-toggle.js` holds an embedded translation object for EN/UK. Elements with `data-i18n` attributes get their text replaced on language switch. Language and theme selections are persisted in `localStorage`.

**CSS build:** Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/cli`. Source is `assets/css/input.css`; output is `assets/css/output.css`. The stylesheet is linked as a blocking `<link>` (not preloaded) to prevent CLS.

**Mobile menu:** Nav menu has `hidden` class by default. `menu.js` removes/adds it on burger/close button clicks.

### Testing notes

- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/genuim.spec.js` cover theme toggle, language toggle, mobile menu, localStorage persistence, and required elements.
- CI runs Chromium only (`--project=chromium`). Local dev runs Chromium + Firefox + WebKit.
- Playwright `baseURL` defaults to `http://localhost:3000`; override with `BASE_URL` env var.
- Jest unit tests use `jsdom` environment; `tests/setup.js` mocks `localStorage` and `window.matchMedia`.
