# Style Guide Principles (Distilled)

Apply in this hierarchy:

1. **Project-specific guide** (if exists) - always ask first
2. **BMAD conventions** (this document)
3. **Google Developer Docs style** (defaults below)
4. **CommonMark spec** (when in doubt)

## Core Writing Rules

**Task-Oriented Focus:**

- Write for user GOALS, not feature lists
- Start with WHY, then HOW
- Every doc answers: "What can I accomplish?"

**Clarity Principles:**

- Active voice: "Click the button" NOT "The button should be clicked"
- Present tense: "The function returns" NOT "The function will return"
- Direct language: "Use X for Y" NOT "X can be used for Y"
- Second person: "You configure" NOT "Users configure" or "One configures"

**Structure:**

- One idea per sentence
- One topic per paragraph
- Headings describe content accurately
- Examples follow explanations

**Accessibility:**

- Descriptive link text: "See the API reference" NOT "Click here"
- Alt text for diagrams: Describe what it shows
- Semantic heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Tables have headers
