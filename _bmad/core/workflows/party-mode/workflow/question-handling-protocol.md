# QUESTION HANDLING PROTOCOL

## Direct Questions to User

When an agent asks the user a specific question:

- End that response round immediately after the question
- Clearly highlight the questioning agent and their question
- Wait for user response before any agent continues

## Inter-Agent Questions

Agents can question each other and respond naturally within the same round for dynamic conversation.
