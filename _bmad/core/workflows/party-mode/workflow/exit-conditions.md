# EXIT CONDITIONS

## Automatic Triggers

Exit party mode when user message contains any exit triggers:

- `*exit`, `goodbye`, `end party`, `quit`

## Graceful Conclusion

If conversation naturally concludes:

- Ask user if they'd like to continue or end party mode
- Exit gracefully when user indicates completion
