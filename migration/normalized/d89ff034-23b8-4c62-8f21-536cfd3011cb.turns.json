For each workflow row, resolve its `output-location` variables against that module's config so artifact paths can be searched. Also extract `communication_language` and `project_knowledge` from each scanned module's config.\n    58→\n    59→3. **Ground in project knowledge** — If `project_knowledge` resolves to an existing path, read available documentation files (architecture docs, project overview, tech stack references) for grounding context. Use discovered project facts when composing any project-specific output. Never fabricate project-specific details — if documentation is unavailable, state so.\n    60→\n    61→4. **Detect active module** — Use MODULE DETECTION above\n    62→\n    63→5. **Analyze input** — Task may provide a workflow name/code, conversational phrase, or nothing. Infer what was just completed using INPUT ANALYSIS above.\n    64→\n    65→6. **Present recommendations** — Show next steps based on:\n    66→   - Completed workflows detected\n    67→   - Phase/sequence ordering (ROUTING RULES)\n    68→   - Artifact presence\n    69→\n    70→   **Optional items first** — List optional workflows until a required step is reached\n    71→   **Required items next** — List the next required workflow\n    72→\n    73→   For each item, apply DISPLAY RULES above and include:\n    74→   - Workflow **name**\n    75→   - **Command** OR **Code + Agent load instruction** (per DISPLAY RULES)\n    76→   - **Agent** title and display name from the CSV (e.g., \"🎨 Alex (Designer)\")\n    77→   - Brief **description**\n    78→\n    79→7. **Additional guidance to convey**:\n    80→   - Present all output in `{communication_language}`\n    81→   - Run each workflow in a **fresh context window**\n    82→   - For **validation workflows**: recommend using a different high-quality LLM if available\n    83→   - For conversational requests: match the user's tone while presenting clearly\n    84→\n    85→8. Return to the calling process after presenting recommendations.\n    86→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.
