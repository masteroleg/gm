Validate PRD** — проверить PRD на полноту и качество\n- Команда: `/bmad-bmm-validate-prd`\n- Агент: John, 📋 Product Manager\n- Описание: Валидация PRD — насколько он исчерпывающий, стройный и связный. Рекомендуется выполнять в другом LLM для независимого взгляда.\n\n**2. Edit PRD** — улучшить существующий PRD\n- Команда: `/bmad-bmm-edit-prd`\n- Агент: John, 📋 Product Manager\n- Описание: Доработка и улучшение PRD на основе обратной связи.\n\n**3. Create UX Design** — спроектировать UX\n- Команда: `/bmad-bmm-create-ux-design`\n- Агент: Sally, 🎨 UX Designer\n- Описание: Настоятельно рекомендуется, если UI — ключевая часть проекта.\n\n---\n\n### Обязательный следующий этап (Phase 3-solutioning)\n\n**4. ⚡ Create Architecture** *(required)*\n- Команда: `/bmad-bmm-create-architecture`\n- Агент: Winston, 🏗️ Architect\n- Описание: Guided workflow для документирования технических решений. Без архитектуры нельзя перейти к Epics & Stories.\n\n---\n\n> **Напоминание:** Каждый workflow запускать в **новом контексте окна**. Для валидационных шагов — желательно использовать другой высококачественный LLM."
