Analyze Current State\n    54→\n    55→**State Assessment:**\n    56→Review the frontmatter to understand:\n    57→\n    58→- `stepsCompleted`: Array of completed step filenames\n    59→- Last element of `stepsCompleted` array: The most recently completed step\n    60→- `inputDocuments`: What context was already loaded\n    61→- All other frontmatter variables\n    62→\n    63→### 2. Restore Context Documents\n    64→\n    65→**Context Reloading:**\n    66→\n    67→- For each document in `inputDocuments`, load the complete file\n    68→- This ensures you have full context for continuation\n    69→- Don't discover new documents - only reload what was previously processed\n    70→\n    71→### 3. Determine Next Step\n    72→\n    73→**Simplified Next Step Logic:**\n    74→1. Get the last element from the `stepsCompleted` array (this is the filename of the last completed step, e.g., \"step-03-success.md\")\n    75→2. Load that step file and read its frontmatter\n    76→3. Extract the `nextStepFile` value from the frontmatter\n    77→4. That's the next step to load!\n    78→\n    79→**Example:**\n    80→- If `stepsCompleted = [\"step-01-init.md\", \"step-02-discovery.md\", \"step-03-success.md\"]`\n    81→- Last element is `\"step-03-success.md\"`\n    82→- Load `step-03-success.md`, read its frontmatter\n    83→- Find `nextStepFile: './step-04-journeys.md'`\n    84→- Next step to load is `./step-04-journeys.md`\n    85→\n    86→### 4. Handle Workflow Completion\n    87→\n    88→**If `stepsCompleted` array contains `\"step-11-complete.md\"`:**\n    89→\"Great news! It looks like we've already completed the PRD workflow for {{project_name}}.\n    90→\n    91→The final document is ready at `{outputFile}` with all sections completed.\n    92→\n    93→Would you like me to:\n    94→\n    95→- Review the completed PRD with you\n    96→- Suggest next workflow steps (like architecture or epic creation)\n    97→- Start a new PRD revision\n    98→\n    99→What would be most helpful?\"\n   100→\n   101→### 5. Present Current Progress\n   102→\n   103→**If workflow not complete:**\n   104→\"Welcome back {{user_name}}! I'm resuming our PRD collaboration for {{project_name}}.\n   105→\n   106→**Current Progress:**\n   107→- Last completed: {last step filename from stepsCompleted array}\n   108→- Next up: {nextStepFile determined from that step's frontmatter}\n   109→- Context documents available: {len(inputDocuments)} files\n   110→\n   111→**Document Status:**\n   112→- Current PRD document is ready with all completed sections\n   113→- Ready to continue from where we left off\n   114→\n   115→Does this look right, or do you want to make any adjustments before we proceed?\"\n   116→\n   117→### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n   118→\n   119→Display: \"**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to {next step name}\"\n   120→\n   121→#### Menu Handling Logic:\n   122→\n   123→- IF C: Read fully and follow the {nextStepFile} determined in step 3\n   124→- IF Any other comments or queries: respond and redisplay menu\n   125→\n   126→#### EXECUTION RULES:\n   127→\n   128→- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n   129→- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n   130→\n   131→## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n   132→\n   133→ONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [current state confirmed], will you then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile} to resume the workflow.\n   134→\n   135→---\n   136→\n   137→## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n   138→\n   139→### ✅ SUCCESS:\n   140→\n   141→- All previous input documents successfully reloaded\n   142→- Current workflow state accurately analyzed and presented\n   143→- User confirms understanding of progress before continuation\n   144→- Correct next step identified and prepared for loading\n   145→\n   146→### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n   147→\n   148→- Discovering new input documents instead of reloading existing ones\n   149→- Modifying content from already completed steps\n   150→- Failing to extract nextStepFile from the last completed step's frontmatter\n   151→- Proceeding without user confirmation of current state\n   152→\n   153→**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n   154→"
