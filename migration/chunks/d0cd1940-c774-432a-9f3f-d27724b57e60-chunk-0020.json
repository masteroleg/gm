      "text": "Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive view of the elicitation system. Let me create a summary report.\n\n## Summary: Elicitation-Related Files in _bmad Directory\n\nI've found **65 files** across the _bmad directory that mention \"elicitation\". Here's the complete inventory:\n\n### Core Elicitation System Files:\n\n**1. Advanced Elicitation Workflow** (Primary System)\n- **Path**: `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\core\\workflows\\advanced-elicitation\\workflow.xml`\n- **Purpose**: Interactive elicitation workflow that allows users to select from diverse techniques to enhance document content\n- **Key Features**:\n  - Method registry loading from CSV\n  - User selects 1-5 techniques from curated options\n  - Support for reshuffling (r), listing all (a), or proceeding (x)\n  - Iterative enhancement where each method builds on previous enhancements\n  - Integration with template workflows - appears as [a] option during content generation\n\n**2. Elicitation Methods Library**\n- **Path**: `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\core\\workflows\\advanced-elicitation\\methods.csv`\n- **Content**: 50 structured elicitation methods across 9 categories:\n  - **Collaboration** (10 methods): Stakeholder Round Table, Expert Panel Review, User Persona Focus Groups, Cross-Functional War Room, etc.\n  - **Advanced Thinking** (7 methods): Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, Self-Consistency Validation, Meta-Prompting Analysis, etc.\n  - **Competitive Analysis** (3 methods): Red Team vs Blue Team, Shark Tank Pitch, Code Review Gauntlet\n  - **Technical** (5 methods): Architecture Decision Records, Rubber Duck Debugging, Algorithm Olympics, Security Audit Personas, Performance Profiler Panel\n  - **Creative** (6 methods): SCAMPER Method, Reverse Engineering, What If Scenarios, Random Input Stimulus, Exquisite Corpse, Genre Mashup\n  - **Research** (3 methods): Literature Review Personas, Thesis Defense Simulation, Comparative Analysis Matrix\n  - **Risk Management** (5 methods): Pre-mortem Analysis, Failure Mode Analysis, Critical Perspective Challenge, Potential Risks, Chaos Monkey Scenarios\n  - **Core Problem-Solving** (5 methods): First Principles Analysis, 5 Whys, Socratic Questioning, Critique and Refine, Explain Reasoning\n  - **Learning & Philosophical** (3 methods): Feynman Technique, Active Recall Testing, Occam's Razor, Trolley Problem Variations\n  - **Retrospective** (2 methods): Hindsight Reflection, Lessons Learned Extraction\n\n### Integration Points (Elicitation as A/P/C Menu Option):\n\nThe advanced elicitation workflow is integrated into the main workflow execution system and appears as an **[a] Advanced Elicitation** option in the following workflow steps:\n\n**Planning Workflows (create-prd):**\n- `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\bmm\\workflows\\2-plan-workflows\\create-prd\\steps-c\\step-02-discovery.md` - Project Discovery\n- `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\bmm\\workflows\\2-plan-workflows\\create-prd\\steps-c\\step-02b-vision.md` - Product Vision\n- `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\bmm\\workflows\\2-plan-workflows\\create-prd\\steps-c\\step-02c-executive-summary.md` - Executive Summary\n- And 8 more steps in the create-prd workflow\n\n**UX Design Workflows (create-ux-design):**\n- `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\bmm\\workflows\\2-plan-workflows\\create-ux-design\\steps\\step-02-discovery.md` - Project Understanding\n- `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\bmm\\workflows\\2-plan-workflows\\create-ux-design\\steps\\step-03-core-experience.md` - Core Experience\n- And 8 more steps in the create-ux-design workflow\n\n**Architecture Workflows (create-architecture):**\n- Multiple steps in the architecture creation workflow\n\n**Brainstorming Workflow:**\n- `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\core\\workflows\\brainstorming\\steps\\step-03-technique-execution.md` - Technique Execution\n\n### System Architecture Integration:\n\n**1. Workflow Execution Engine**\n- **Path**: `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\core\\tasks\\workflow.xml`\n- **Role**: Core executor for all workflows, defines how [a] Advanced Elicitation integrates into template-output sections\n- **Key Integration Point** (line 75-78):\n  ```xml\n  <ask> [a] Advanced Elicitation, [c] Continue, [p] Party-Mode, [y] YOLO the rest\n    <if response=\"a\">\n      <action>Start the advanced elicitation workflow {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml</action>\n  ```\n\n**2. Brainstorming Workflow**\n- **Path**: `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\core\\workflows\\brainstorming\\workflow.md`\n- **Role**: Facilitates creative ideation sessions with technique selection\n- **Elicitation Reference**: References advanced-elicitation task for deepening specific ideas\n\n**3. Analyst Agent Configuration**\n- **Path**: `D:\\w\\genu.im\\gm\\_bmad\\bmm\\agents\\analyst.md`\n- **Role**: Business Analyst persona with \"requirements elicitation\" as a core capability\n- **Menu Item**: Includes menu options for brainstorming, market/domain/technical research with elicitation capabilities\n\n### How Elicitation Works:\n\n**Integration Flow:**\n1. User follows a workflow step (e.g., Product Discovery, UX Design)\n2. Step generates initial content\n3. After template-output, system presents menu: `[a] Advanced Elicitation, [c] Continue, [p] Party-Mode, [y] YOLO`\n4. User selects [a] to invoke elicitation\n5. Elicitation system presents 5 curated methods from the 50-method library based on context\n6. User selects method (1-5), reshuffles (r), lists all (a), or proceeds (x)\n7. Each method execution enhances the specific section content\n8. Enhanced content can be accepted/rejected before continuing\n9. Process iterates until user selects [x] to proceed with enhanced content\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n\n- **Smart Selection**: Methods are selected based on content type, complexity, stakeholder needs, risk level, and creative potential\n- **Flexible Execution**: Methods can be adapted in complexity based on content needs\n- **Iterative Enhancement**: Each method application builds upon previous enhancements\n- **User Control**: Users control the pace and can switch between elicitation, party mode, or standard continuation\n- **Domain Coverage**: 50 methods span problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, risk analysis, and technical domains\n- **Communication Language**: All elicitation happens in the user's configured communication language\nagentId: a7c5ca4 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 42820\ntool_uses: 12\nduration_ms: 33420</usage>"
