Check for Existing Workflow State\n    63→\n    64→First, check if the output document already exists:\n    65→\n    66→**Workflow State Detection:**\n    67→\n    68→- Look for file at `{outputFile}`\n    69→- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n    70→- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n    71→\n    72→### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n    73→\n    74→If the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted` BUT `step-11-complete` is NOT in the list, follow the Continuation Protocol since the document is incomplete:\n    75→\n    76→**Continuation Protocol:**\n    77→\n    78→- **STOP immediately** and load `{continueStepFile}`\n    79→- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n    80→- Let step-01b handle all continuation logic\n    81→- This is an auto-proceed situation - no user choice needed\n    82→\n    83→### 3.

Input Document Discovery\n    88→\n    89→Discover and load context documents using smart discovery.

For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n    96→\n    97→Try to discover the following:\n    98→- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n    99→- Research Documents (`/*research*.md`)\n   100→- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n   101→- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n   102→\n   103→<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n   104→\n   105→**Loading Rules:**\n   106→\n   107→- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n   108→- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n   109→- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n   110→- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n   111→- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n   112→\n   113→#### B. Create Initial Document\n   114→\n   115→**Document Setup:**\n   116→\n   117→- Copy the template from `{prdTemplate}` to `{outputFile}`\n   118→- Initialize frontmatter with proper structure including inputDocuments array.\n   119→\n   120→#### C.
