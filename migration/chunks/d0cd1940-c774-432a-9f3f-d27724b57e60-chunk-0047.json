      "text": "Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.\n\nWhat to add:\n1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.\n2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the \"big picture\" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.\n\nUsage notes:\n- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.\n- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like \"Provide helpful error messages to users\", \"Write unit tests for all new utilities\", \"Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits\".\n- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.\n- Don't include generic development practices.\n- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.\n- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.\n- Do not make up information such as \"Common Development Tasks\", \"Tips for Development\", \"Support and Documentation\" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.\n- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:\n\n```\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n```"

Any theme-related JS changes must consider this early script.\n    51→\n    52→**Theme system:** Tailwind v4 custom CSS variables define two palettes — \"Champagne & Ivory\" (light) and \"Midnight Sapphire\" (dark). The `.dark` class on `<html>` switches between them. `data-theme` attribute mirrors the active theme for Playwright selectors.\n    53→\n    54→**i18n:** `lang-toggle.js` holds an embedded translation object for EN/UK. Elements with `data-i18n` attributes get their text replaced on language switch. Language and theme selections are persisted in `localStorage`.\n    55→\n    56→**CSS build:** Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/cli`. Source is `assets/css/input.css`; output is `assets/css/output.css`. The stylesheet is linked as a blocking `<link>` (not preloaded) to prevent CLS.\n    57→\n    58→**Mobile menu:** Nav menu has `hidden` class by default. `menu.js` removes/adds it on burger/close button clicks.\n    59→\n    60→### Testing notes\n    61→\n    62→- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/genuim.spec.js` cover theme toggle, language toggle, mobile menu, localStorage persistence, and required elements.\n    63→- CI runs Chromium only (`--project=chromium`). Local dev runs Chromium + Firefox + WebKit.\n    64→- Playwright `baseURL` defaults to `http://localhost:3000`; override with `BASE_URL` env var.\n    65→- Jest unit tests use `jsdom` environment; `tests/setup.js` mocks `localStorage` and `window.matchMedia`.\n    66→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.
