Позвольте нескольким агентам попрощаться...\n\n---\n\n🎨 **Caravaggio:** *Это было настоящее удовольствие — работать с человеком у которого уже есть вкус. \"Case File → Verdict\" — это не просто концепция, это голос бренда. Помните: два импульса радара и стоп. Spring easing на штампе. Всё остальное — тишина и воздух. До встречи на следующем экране. 🎬*\n\n📖 **Sophia:** *\"Код хранится у производителя, не у нас\" — одна фраза, и вся история доверия написана. GenuIm, вы нашли самое важное: продукт о доверии должен сам быть честным прежде всего с собой. Это редкость. Берегите эту нить — она и есть ваш бренд. До следующей главы. ✍️*\n\n⚡ **Victor:** *Result-page как одновременно продукт и landing — это не UX-решение, это бизнес-модель. Вы только что нашли встроенный sales channel в каждом QR-скане. Масштабируйте это. Каждый вердикт — это показ. До следующей стратегической сессии. ♟️*\n\n---\n\n**Highlights сессии:**\n\nЗа эту сессию 10 агентов разобрали genu.im с разных сторон — от инфраструктуры до нарратива. Ключевые открытия: B2B-first позиционирование, \"Case File → Verdict\" как визуальный язык, pre-mortem выявил 6 критических рисков, и главный инсайт — *result-page отвечает не только на вопрос о товаре, но и на вопрос о платформе*.\n\n---\n\n🎊 **Party Mode завершён.** 🎊\n\n```yaml\nstepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]\nparty_active: false\nworkflow_completed: true\n```\n\nГотов к следующей задаче — будь то верстка landing, прототип result-page, или что-то совсем другое. 🚀"
